# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan is prepared to ensure that Santa Teresa High School will know what the minimum technical requirements are for the APCS-Principles class.

## Context

### Course  APCS-Principles

Grade: 9 - 12

"AP Computer Science Principles is an introductory college-level computing course that introduces students to the breadth of the field of computer science. Students learn to design and evaluate solutions and to apply computer science to solve problems through the development of algorithms and programs. They incorporate abstraction into programs and use data to discover new knowledge. Students also explain how computing innovations and computing systems—including the internet—work, explore their potential impacts, and contribute to a computing culture that is collaborative and ethical." -- College Board

### Situation

Santa Teresa High School is one of eleven high schools in the Eastside Union High School District. In 2013, we started teaching Exploring CS. In 2015, we added APCS-A (Java). We did not participate in APCS-P in 2017 when it first came out, and we started teaching APCS-P in 2018.

CS has become popular in our school, and at the moment, we have eight CS classes. We currently has only one computer lab, and the other three classes are taught in the library's computer lab, which is not a proper classroom. With its growth rate, within the next two years, we will have ten CS classes. This calls for having two computer labs. This means more hardware (computers, Android devices), software licenses, and more demand from the network for efficient Internet speed.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

1. Courseware

    We use mobile-CSP, and the courseware is supplied in Runestone.

    The student version is in https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp.

    The teacher version is in https://csawesome.runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/teach-mobilecsp

    mobile-CSP uses MIT's App Inventor (IDE). This is an app totally run on the web. We use this for our coding exercises.

2. Assessment software

    Our district provides us with IlluminteEd.

    I sometimes use Kahoot just to have some fun.

3. Reference software
    
    There are many sites with free APCS-P software which we can use as reference:

    - Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC)
    - Code.org
    - CodeAcademy
    - CodeHS
    - CSAwesome
    - projectSTEM.org

4.  Classroom aids 

    - Google Classroom
    - Jamboard (electronic whiteboard)
    - SchoolLoop (teacher grading system)
    - Naviance (official district grade reporting system)
    - Google G suite
    - Microsoft Office

### Hardware Specifications
1.  Course

    While I understand that chromebooks are probably good enough for the purpose of running this course, I would like to recommend PC laptops.  I am hoping that my students will be doing more challenging projects that require the power of a "real" PC.  The minimum requirements will be:
    - Intel i7 processor
    - 16 GB RAM 
    - 64-bit operating system
    - Windows 10 
    - **no** touch type (less finger prints on the screen)

    Android device (phone or tablet) with minimum requirements:
    - 4 GB RAM
    - 8 GB storge
    - Android operating system
    - GPS
    - Accelerometer
    - Camera

    Why **Android**?  We use mobilecsp, which uses App Inventor to write apps.  The MIT's team has tried to make App Inventor works for both Android and iOS.  The Android OS has beework with Apple to make App Inventor works for iOS, but every time when Apple update the iOS version, App Inventor will stop working.

    The teacher's laptop and Android device requirements are the same as the students'.
    
2. Classroom Aid

    An overhead projector in the classroom is a must.  Teachers need to show students what to do, and students need to be able to see the projection no matter where they sit.

###  Network Specifications

The computers need gigabit ethernet connectivity and wireless connectivity.

The Android devices need wireless connectivity. The phone should be unlocked because we do not need the phone to connect to the phone network.

It is a requirement that the computer and the Android device must run on the same wifi network. So it is important that the school allows students to log on to the wifi network.

Why bother with **ethernet**?  Well, we seem to have bad Internet connection.  When that happens, students can still be connected via ethernet and get other work done.

### Application

1.  Learning in class

    Teacher will teach using App Inventor, PowerPoints, Videos, and/or Jamboard (electronic Whiteboard) via the overhead projector.
    
    I use App Inventor because APCS-P emphasizes on algorithm and abstraction.  App Inventor is block-based and it is a perfect tool when we want to teach students algorithm without them having to struggle with the syntax of a language or to solve the compile errors because of a misspelling or a missing semicolon.  Most of the time, in App Inventor, if you can click the pieces together, then you are OK with the syntax.  This means the only thing students need to worry about is the logic errors, which is exactly what I want to teach in APCS-P.
    
    I use PowerPoint to teach in general.  My slide deck usually contains the concepts I want to teach, the hook to the concept, the spec of the collaborative activity, the spec of the program that students have to do, and some multiple choice and short questions to check for understanding throughout the lesson.
    
    I use videos to supplement my notes so the concepts can be presented in different ways, usually more interesting.  This reinforces the concepts and students will understand and remember them better.
    
    I use Jamboard to allow students to collaborate.  Sometimes I use one jamboard for the class, and sometimes students have a jamboard for their group.  This makes collaboration a lot easier.  Some students may prefer Google Doc, but Jamboard is more like having sticky notes on the whiteboard.  You can move them around, and group ideas together, which is easier to do than using Google Doc.
    
2.  Doing Class Work
    
    Students will use App Inventor to write their apps, and will use Google Doc or Microsoft Word to do their reflections or App write-up.
    
    Even though it is a CS class, students have to write in English as well as writing code.  Being able to write is very important in terms of communication.  Students get assignments for app write-up (students have to explain why and how the code works) and reflection for what they learn in class (e.g. Why do we need to use encrption when transmitting data?  What if we don't use encrption?...)  Students can use anything to do their write-up.  Most write-up is to be done by the student only, so they don't have to use Google G suite if they choose not to.
 
3.  Collaboration and Communication

    Students will use Google G suite to collaborate -- they can share Google Doc or Slides.
    
    Students will communicate with teachers by asking questions in class or after school.  If they are at home, they can use email.  Ocasionally when required (e.g. a student has been sick for a while), we can Zoom.
    
4.  Turning in Homework
    
    Students can turn in their homework in Google Classroom.  Teacher will grade assignments from Google Classroom, and then export grades to School Loop because School Loop is our school's official current grade reporting system (as opposed to Naviance, which is the district's official grade reporting system for marking periods).
    
5.  Assessments 

    For quizzes, tests, and final exam, we will use IlluminateEd to create the assessments, and then students can go there to do the assessments.  Multiple choice questions will be automatically graded.  IlluminateEd is not the best software for entering test questions, it is very tedious; but this is the only test generator software that we have.
    
    Sometimes I use Kahoot to give students quick tests.  The competition creates some fun.
    
6.  Assessments -- Performance Tasks

    Performance Tasks will have to be done using App Inventor to create the program, and then Google Doc or Microsoft Word will be used to answer the prompts from College Board.  This is worth 30% of the AP exam.  The student-created Performance Task has to be submitted to CollegeBoard by the end of April, and the 2-hour 74-question exam is in May.
 
7.  Checking Grades

    Students can check their current grades in SchoolLoop any time and their official posted grade in Naviance at the end of each marking period.
    
8.  Pedagogy

    I use App Inventor, a block based programming language to teach this course so students can concentrate on the logical flow rather than having to worry about the syntax of the programming language.  The programs students write are usually related to the concepts that they are learning -- this is the project-based approach where we apply programming knowledge to real-world scenarios, e.g. when we are learning encrption, we write a program for Caesar Cypher, which is an encrption algorithm.  I also use code tracing to improve program comprehension -- quite often when students ask me for help, I will ask them to trace the code, and most of the time, they figure out what is wrong while tracing the code.

9.  A typical lesson

    a.  A lesson usually starts with my PowerPoint.  It will start with the hook to capture student's attention.
    
    b.  I will teach the concept.
    
    c.  Sometimes I show a video.
    
    d.  Sometimes there is a collaboration activity to do.  Students will use Jamboard here.
    
    e.  Sometimes there is programming to do.  Students will use App Inventor here.
    
    f.  I will use the PowerPoint to show some multiple choice or short answers to check for understanding.
    
    g.  I will post a few prompting questions so students can write their reflection on the lesson.
    
### Impacts

There is a high demand in Computer Science (CS) jobs now and possibly for the next many years.  However, it is difficult to convince students to do Computer Science because many students view CS as a difficult subject, and they don't want to even try it.  This particular happens to underserved students.  Every year, I go to the parent groups of underserved students to sell the CS programs.  I usually manage to convince a few students to try.

This Educational Technical plan ensures that the class will go smoothly so students will not give up due to technical difficulty.  The underserved students will be the first ones to give up because when things don't go the correct way, they will think that it is their fault, ...  

#### APCS-Principles
I taught APCS-A before APCS-Principles exist.  Students only had Exploring CS, and then they did Java.  It requires a lot of hard work to catch up with the curriculum, and not many students can do it.  I really love APCS-Principles.  It sits between Exploring CS and APCS-A.  APCS-Principles deals with the algorithm and abstraction, so it saves teachers time to teach these concepts in the Java class.  I found that most students did a lot matter if they had taken APCS-Principles before APCS-A.  So this class is going to give students confidence in coding.

#### Coming Back from Distance Learning (DL)

Some students are not coping well coming back from DL.  They found it hard to adjust to the In-Person (IP) schedule.  They were still playing games at home, so homework never got done.  Not to mention that they were not learning as much as they could while DLing.  All these just became too much for students, and many had declared having anxiety or mental health problems.

Our Educational Technical plan will reduce their stress of having to deal with technical problems.

#### Going Back to Distance Learning

I we ever have to go back to DL, students will not have the luxury of working on a PC, unless they personally have one.  The district had allowed for one Chromebook per student.  It really is not satisfactory, but since Santa Teresa is not a Title I school, we do not have the funding to buy all CS students (250) a PC laptop.  The good news is that the class can still go on even though it is not ideal.

####  Expanding too Fast

As mentioned before, we really should build another computer lab.  That would be something that admin should budget for soon.
